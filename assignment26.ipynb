      "Here's a more detailed explanation of each step in making coffee:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Choose Your Coffee:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Beans vs. Ground:** Whole beans are always fresher and retain more flavor. Invest in a burr grinder for the best grind consistency. \n",
      "* **Roast Level:**\n",
      "    * **Light:** Bright acidity, lighter body, fruity and floral notes.\n",
      "    * **Medium:** Balanced acidity and body, nutty and chocolatey flavors.\n",
      "    * **Dark:** Bold and bitter, smoky and roasted flavors, often oily.\n",
      "* **Origin:** Different regions have unique climates and soil that influence coffee flavor. \n",
      "    * **Latin America:**  Often known for chocolatey, nutty, and caramel notes.\n",
      "    * **Africa:**  Tends to have bright acidity, fruity and floral aromas.\n",
      "    * **Asia/Pacific:**  Earthy, spicy, and sometimes woody flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Measure the Coffee:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **General Guideline:**  A good starting point is 1-2 tablespoons of ground coffee for every 6 ounces of water. \n",
      "* **Adjust to Taste:** Experiment to find your ideal strength. More coffee = stronger brew.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Heat the Water:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Ideal Temperature:** 90-96°C (194-205°F). Too hot (boiling) will burn the coffee and create a bitter taste.\n",
      "* **Use a Thermometer:** For precise temperature control.\n",
      "* **Alternative:** Let freshly boiled water cool for a minute or two before brewing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Brew the Coffee:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Drip Machine:**  Follow the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure filters are clean and use fresh water.\n",
      "* **French Press:**\n",
      "    * Add coarsely ground coffee to the press.\n",
      "    * Pour hot water over the grounds, ensuring all grounds are saturated.\n",
      "    * Stir gently.\n",
      "    * Place the plunger on top (don't press down yet).\n",
      "    * Steep for 4 minutes.\n",
      "    * Slowly press the plunger down.\n",
      "    * Pour and enjoy.\n",
      "* **Pour Over:**\n",
      "    * Place a filter in your pour-over device.\n",
      "    * Add medium-fine ground coffee to the filter.\n",
      "    * Slowly pour hot water in a circular motion, ensuring all grounds are evenly saturated.\n",
      "    * Let the coffee drip through completely.\n",
      "* **Espresso Machine:**\n",
      "    * Grind finely.\n",
      "    * Tamp the grounds firmly in the portafilter.\n",
      "    * Lock the portafilter into the machine.\n",
      "    * Brew for 25-30 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Wait & Extract:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Brew Time:** Varies depending on the method:\n",
      "    * Drip machine: 4-6 minutes\n",
      "    * French press: 4 minutes\n",
      "    * Pour over: 3-4 minutes\n",
      "    * Espresso: 25-30 seconds\n",
      "* **Observe:** Watch the brewing process.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Serve & Enjoy:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Pour:**  Into your favorite mug.\n",
      "* **Customize:** Add milk, sugar, cream, or flavored syrups to your liking.\n",
      "* **Savor:**  Enjoy the aroma and flavor of your freshly brewed coffee!\n",
